Final project of the course Computational methods in molecular quantum mechanics given by the professor Bonella Sara. 

This project consisted in simulating the behaviour of a MoS2 crystal under mechanical excitation.
In particular, the study targets to find the *phonon* response of the described lattice along different directions.

The file [Raffaele_Ancarola_project8.pdf](Raffaele_Ancarola_project8.pdf) is a presentation of the whole project, containing setup and parameters of [Quantum Espresso](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/).
